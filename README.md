# Schedule App

This is my student project to systematize and simplify interaction with the curriculum. In it, you can easily get a schedule for a group/teacher/auditorium.  The application has a convenient search, as well as the ability to add or remove a group/teacher/auditorium to favorites.

If you want to use it for your needs, then you need to rewrite the `Main Repository` for your API and most likely rewrite all models.
